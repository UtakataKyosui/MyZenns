# Gemini on OpenHands

This article explores the possibility of using Gemini to fully automate issue-driven development on OpenHands.

## Idea

By creating a Gemini API key and registering it with OpenHands, and further utilizing the gemini-code-assist GitHub App for code review, we can potentially achieve a development process with minimal manual effort.

## Steps

1.  Create a Gemini API key.
2.  Register the API key with OpenHands.
3.  Install the gemini-code-assist GitHub App.
4.  Configure the app to review code.

## Conclusion

This setup could potentially lead to a highly automated development workflow, where Gemini handles most of the coding and reviewing tasks.
